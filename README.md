Smart House is a distributed system for controlling multimedia devices and home automation. 

With various type of input devices(IR remote controller, mobile, desktop, web, messagener bot, Cortana voice) I can controll Pandora radio, MPD music player, TV, Yamaha RX-V481 amplifer, air conditioner.... I also implemented metro lyrics and last.fm api for music.
